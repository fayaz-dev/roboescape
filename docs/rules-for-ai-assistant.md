# Rules AI Assistant must follow

- Assume the application is running, so no need to run any command to start it.
- If the developer provides an error without any additional instruction, it means the AI assistant should attempt to fix it.
- Use Design Patters and Software Engineering principles to solve problems.
- If the AI assistant discovers any issue while doing an unrelated task, it should inform the developer and ask the developer what to do without trying to fix it first.
