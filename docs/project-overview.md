## Project Description
This is a space adventure game where the player controls a Robot named Robonaut to navigate it in space by avoiding a black hole and collecting exotic particles. Score is calculated based on the number of exotic particles collected. Going close enough to the black hole's event horizon will cause the player to be sucked into the black hole and that ends the game. The player can escape from the black hole's gravity  by using emergency thrusters, but this costs 1 exotic particle per second. The game is designed to be challenging and fun, with smooth animations and responsive gameplay.

## Developer Overview
This game is built with vanilla JavaScript and uses Canvas (with Three.js) for rendering graphics and Web Audio API for game sounds.
